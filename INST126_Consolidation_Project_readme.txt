I programmed a Dice Game called "Tuple Out". The goal of the game is to score the most points with the
dice. There are 3 dice, and each has 6 sides. The player is asked to roll the dice, and after receiving
the output, if there are 2 dice with the same value, they are fixed and cannot be re-rolled. The player
is given the option to re-roll the third dice to receive a higher score. They are able to re-roll the 
third dice as many times as they would like until they decide to stop or until they tuple out. If the 
player decides not to re-roll the third dice, their turn ends. To tuple out, it means that all 3 dice 
are rolled with the same number, causing their to end, and resulting in zero points for that turn.
If all dice are rolled with different numbers, the player is still given the option to re-roll all of the
dice for a chance to receive a higher score. If the player chooses not to re-roll the dice, the game is
over.
